# A Two Input Calculator 

One of my many useless side projects. Who needs a calculator that supports more than two inputs anyway? 

## Usage 

python twoinputcalculator.py

It will then ask you to for the first number, then operation, and finally the second number. 

## Example 
```
    Enter first number: 20
    Enter the operation: +,-,*, ^ (**), %, //, or /: **
    Enter second number: 10
    Result: 10,240,000,000,000
    Would you like to continue? (Y for Yes / N for No): N
```
